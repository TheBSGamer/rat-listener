# Rat Listener

![Audit trail banner](/assets/audit_trail.png)

A Discord bot built on discord.js v14 that simply monitors join, leave, move, and move events initiated by another user (someone with the 'MOVE_MEMBERS' permission) for voice channels in your server. It is customizable and will log members of the voice call and a Discord timestamp that shows the time of the event down to the second.

> **Important**
> This bot is intentionally made to *not* be used in multiple guilds due to the volume of messages that may come through in some guilds. If you want to use it in multiple guilds, you will need to make an instance of the bot for each guild you plan to use it in.
